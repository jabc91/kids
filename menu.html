The MIT community is driven by a shared purpose: to make a better world through education, research, and innovation.
We are fun and quirky, elite but not elitist, inventive and artistic, obsessed with numbers,
and welcoming to talented people regardless of where they come from.</p>

<p>At MIT, we revel in a culture of learning by doing. Our undergraduates work shoulder to shoulder with faculty,
tackle global challenges, pursue fundamental questions, and translate ideas into action.</p>

<p>From science and maths to the languages, and history, we offer excellence across the board.
We also pioneer digital education, which offers flexible access to MIT-rigorous content for learners of all ages.</p>

<p>MIT people are eager to know how things work — and inspired to make them work better.
Our “mind and hand” philosophy spurs real-world engagement, and thanks to MIT’s entrepreneurial culture,
Greater Boston’s innovation ecosystem brims with companies spun out from MIT. We also embrace collaborations
with industry and government, as we seek compelling problems where MIT innovation can make an impact.</p>
